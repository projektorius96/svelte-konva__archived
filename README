### Motivation

> Konva.js is Canvas API framework, which already has wrappers for React, Vue, but there is no (proper?) Svelte wrapper for Konva.js core . This is it ! Finally decided to write a minimum maintanable (live) Svelte wrapper for Konva : just like React, Vue, we can (& will) take advantage of Svelte for its simplicity, built-in state management with svelte/store, etc. 

> I am starting a project as a solo initially, but may accept any PR request upon guidelines provided (the guidelines would appear in the future on-demand i.e. if someone would like to contribute)

### Prerequisite

> 1.1) `npm i` (package.json) or `npm ci` to reproduce identical deps graph (package-lock.json)

> 1.2) `npm run dev:serv`
